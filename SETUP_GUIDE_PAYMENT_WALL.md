## Payment Flow Details

| Step | What Happens | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | User clicks AI Report button | Button disabled, shows "Processing Payment..." |
| 2 | Razorpay SDK loads | Checkout modal appears |
| 3 | Payment completed | Redirect to ML inference |
| 4 | Payment failed | Error message shown, user can retry |
| 5 | ML inference runs | "Generating Report..." status |
| 6 | Report ready | AI image displayed to user |

## Important Notes

⚠️ **No External Backend Needed** for payment - Razorpay handles all payment processing

⚠️ **User Authentication** - Payment requires user to be signed in (already enforced)

⚠️ **S3 Image Storage** - AI reports still stored in S3 as before

⚠️ **Immutable Implementation** - As requested, no existing functions were modified, only wrapped with payment logic

## Troubleshooting

### "Payment configuration not found" Error
- Ensure `VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` is set in your environment
- Restart dev server after adding env variable

### Razorpay Modal Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify internet connection (Razorpay SDK loads from CDN)
- Check that Razorpay domain isn't blocked by browser

### Payment Completes but Report Doesn't Generate
- Check that ML backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- Verify S3 credentials and bucket access
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to enhance further:
1. Add payment receipt/confirmation email
2. Add payment transaction tracking
3. Add refund policy page
4. Track analytics on payment conversion
5. Add promotional discount codes

## Support

All Razorpay functionality is built in. The implementation:
- Uses your live Razorpay key
- Processes real payments in production
- Logs transactions on Razorpay dashboard
- Supports all Razorpay features (webhooks, refunds, etc.)
